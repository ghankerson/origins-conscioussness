# The Gods Within

## An analysis of Erich Neumann's "The Origins and History of Consciousness"

### How I got to this point and what am I doing here?

* In recent years I've become more and more fascinated with myth, Jungian
  psychology and their intersection.

* While researching these themes about 18 months ago I came across Jordan
  Peterson's video on YouTube on [Carl Jung and the Lion
King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI).  I was really wowed by his
analysis of the movie and his ability to tie the themes of the movie to its
underlying mythological and psychological themes. 

* To give you an idea in looking at the first scene of the movie, a sunrise, he
  ties the first seconds of the film to the rise of consciousness, connects the
Lion's mane to the sun and solar gods/kings, the hero's journey to  illuminating
higher consciousness, and rebirth.

* I want to be able to understand and explain this symbolism myself and get to
  the bottom of if if I can. What's at the root of this? Is that question
something we can even answer?

* That led me to starting many books by Jung, Marie Louis Von Franz and Erich
  Neumann, but I have struggled with the themes but the more I dive in; the more
rewarding it becomes.  I'd like to share what I've learned with you.

Eventually I landed on Neumann - a student and then colleague of Jung. His "The
Origins and History of Consciousness" is such a fascinating book on so many
levels. Jungian's like Neumann have an understanding of human history and in
particular Western history and its influence on the individual that is more
comprehensive than anything I have seen. They can cut through thousands of
years of history and find the themes that still heavily influence us today.  I
am also fascinated with Jung's incorporation of myth into his work on the
psyche and the collective unconscious. I became even more interested in reading
this book when seeing Jung's forward where Jung states "if I were granted a
second lease on life I would start to ... sift out all those 'beginnings
without continuation' and knead them into a whole. This difficult and
meritorious task the author has performed with outstanding success."  It seems
even Jung is suggesting this is the book to read. Who am I to differ? 

As intriguing as I have found this book it is a difficult read.  I am not a
Jungian Analyst so I am learning as I go.  I have started the book over five
times. Although re-reading has helped me understand a good deal more of the
concepts Neumann puts forth, each page can be challenging. I have recently
broken up the sidewalk on the east side of my house and reading each page of the
book at times feels analogous to hauling off a large chunk of concrete.  I found
myself wishing for a discussion of the book. Many popular books like the Harry
Potter and Game of Thrones series have podcasts where podcasters go through a
book chapter by chapter and offer analysis. I haven't found such a resource
online as of it yet.  So the next best thing is to do this myself.  This is an
ambitious intellectual task and I will probably lack the expertise to do job a
good Jungian Analyst would do but the process will be enlightening for me as I
hope it is for you..


* Back to Peterson's interpretation of the Lion King.  I think he is
  interpreting the symbolism in a plausible even correct or reasonable way. 

* The strange thing about symbolism is we understand them at some level but they
  are very hard to explain verbally rationally.  Symbols stirs us but they are
so hard to our finger on.   Symbols often point to things we have consciously
forgotten but are still there at an unconscious level so they affect us, stir us
and move us. Jung said a symbol is "something more and other than itself which
eludes our present knowledge." He also called it "the best possible formulation
of a relatively unknown thing, which for that reason cannot be clearly or
characteristically represented."  

* Symbols art typically rich with visual information that can be interpreted in
  many often contradictory ways. 

* The etymology of the word symbol is a good example of this. 

* Jungian analyst Anthony Stevens in his book *Ariadne's Clue* explains
  symbolism as follows. It comes from the Greek word *symbolon* coming from
*sym* which means together, and *ballein* which means to throw. Throw together.
Often an object like a bone would be broken in two with each half being given to
member's of a secret society. The two pieces could be united to create a match
and establish identity. (This is how public key cryptography works at a high
level in computing interestingly enough).  

* Collective unconscious definition: A trans-personal or collective part of the
  psyche that has grown out of evolutionary experience that speaks to the ego in
symbols or archetypes. 

* That is a great microcosm of Jung's model of the psyche. The collective
  unconscious sends messages via symbols to the conscious ego in an effort to
compensate for something that is lacking. If the ego can understand and
assimilate the message, the individual achieves higher consciousness and growth.
Consciousness develops out of the unconscious. Jung called this process
individuation. Neumann in this book outlines what he sees as the stages of
individuation based on mythological projections from the collective unconscious.

* Since the consciousness grows out of the collective unconscious Neumann uses
  the symbol of the Uroboros - a snake or dragon eating its tail. In Neumann's
first stage, the ego is a small germ in the ocean of the collective unconscious.
Think of an infant in his mother's arms or an embryo in the womb.

* The next stage is the adolescent in the clutch of the Great Mother.  In the
  stage the Great Mother is both nurturing and destructive. She raises an infant
son only to sacrifice him in ritual renewal of the seasons.  The son is a corn
god to be raised and felled in perpetual rhythm. 

* Next the hero is born and is faced with the task of the dragon fight and
  recovering captive and treasure. We know this story  from any number of myths
and stories. From the myth of Osiris to St. George and the dragon to King Arthur
and the Knights of the round table to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.  

* Last the hero transforms into a god and achieves immortality. In psychological
  terms the ego finally permanently breaks free of the unconscious.



## Introduction

What is Neumann trying to accomplish in this book? We don't have to read far to
answer this question. In the first sentence of the introduction he states: "The
following attempt outline the archetypal stages of the development of
consciousness is based on modern depth psychology. It is an application of the
analytical psychology of C.J. Jung ..."

The key word here is phases.  His theory outlines what he sees as the stages
of the development of consciousness.

In the next paragraph he states that in contrast to other explanations of
consciousness based largely on environmental conditions, "our inquiry is more
concerned with the internal, psychic and archetypal factors which determine the
course of that development." 

Some definitions are in order here to help us get started:

* Archetype  on the first page of the introduction Neumann gives us a nice
  straight forward definition. "They (archetypes) are the pictorial forms of
instincts, for the unconscious mind in images which as in dreams and fantasies,
initiate the process of conscious reaction and assimilation. ".  Lets repeat
this again: "They (archetypes) are the pictorial forms of
instincts, for the unconscious mind in images which as in dreams and fantasies,
initiate the process of conscious reaction and assimilation. "

* Collective Unconscious: a layer of the psyche that is trans-personal or
  shared.  It's structure is composed of archetypes. 

* Individuation a process of individual increase in consciousness ( perhaps
  analogous to emotional, spiritual and intellectual maturity) by surfacing archetypal
images,  wrestling with their significance, and making them conscious. 

* Complex: a series of archetypal images around a common theme (mother, father,
  money and many many others). When we are complexed about say our mother (or
anything symbolically representative of a mother) we become possessed by the
mother archetype. In other words ideas can have you. We are not blank slates.
More on this to come.

the psyche and Anthony Stevens book on Jung).

Back to what Neumann is trying to accomplish in this book.  He states on page two of the
introduction "It is the task of this book to show that a series of archetypes is
a main constituent of mythology, that they (archetypes) stand in stadial succession in an
organic relation to one another, and that their stadial succession determines
the growth of consciousness. In the course of its ontogenetic (lifetime) development, the
individual ego has to pass through the same archetypal stages which determined
the evolution of consciousness in the life humanity. 

You can see why I said each page of the book is like hauling off a small slab of
concrete - Neumann's words have weight.  What I think he is saying in this
statement is that historically consciousness went through a series of stages of
development. The individual in his lifetime passes through these same stages as
the species. These stages are composed of archetypes - pictoral forms of
instincts. We see these archetypes in mythology.  Think of it this way: from an
evolutionary standpoint it took millions of years to make you. The archetypes,
the collective unconscious and myth are a storehouse of information that we can
tap into to fuel personal growth. Passing through each stage, the ego transforms
its relationship to the archetypes. "The ability to perceive, to understand, and
to interpret these images is a process of succession in time, .. it takes place
in stages." 

Neumann suggests these "stages of conscious development are only a
fraction of archetypal reality as a whole", but using an evolutionary lens, we
can find a "guiding line ...  to help us in the theory and practice of depth
psychology."

The psyche then moves through these developmental stages that are portrayed in
myths during its lifetime.  Getting stuck in a stage then results in a neurosis
until the stage is resolved and the psyche can continue to grow. 

We can get a feel for these stages composed of archetypes by just examining the
section titles of the book.

A. The Creation Myth
	I. The Uroborous
	II. The Great Mother
	III. The Seperation of of World Parents: The Principle of Opposites

B. The Hero Myth
	I. The Birth of the Hero
	II. The Slaying of the Mother
	III. The Slaying of the Father

C. The Transformation Myth 
	I. The Captive and the Treasure
	II. Transformation or Osiris


Why the gods within? For Neumann that which was projected out ward - the gods -
is still with us in our psyches. The collective unconscious is the deeper layer of
humanity that each of us is connected to. This is what he is exploring in this
book. His methodology is to start with a comparative method that gather content, the
symbols and collective material found in individuals and join them with
historical religion and related materials to establish context and then
supplement this with an evolutionary approach  where he considers this content
in relation to the current stage of consciousness under consideration. 

Neumann makes a valiant effort to consider all of mythology - to the extent
someone can can do such a thing - and find in it patterns and stages of
development and in doing this has found a thread that joins the development of
consciousness in stages. He focuses on Western development - although this does
include Mesopotamian and Egyptian myth in addition to European myth. He also
shows how these myth are all developed on top of each other - they are the
stages of development embedded in mythological projections. Neumann goes so far
as to say the structure of modern consciousness rests upon this integration." We
will see more on this when we review the first chapter "The Uroboros".

All of this historical material is still with us.  Think of the classic hero's
journey - the hero slaying the dragon this is the story of Marduk and it goes
back to humanity's first civilization and the story was almost certainly
probably even older.  It's Marduk, Horus and Set, St. George and the Dragon,
King Arthur, and even Harry Potter. These myths resonate with us even today
because the tell us something symbolically about how to live; how to make
darkness into light. 

Even our language is chock full of clues in the etymology of our words. Take the
work "show". A synonym for show is demonstrate. In Spanish we get closer to the
original Latin "demonstrar". We can see the word monster in there de-monstrate
and we are again back to St. George or Marduk killing the dragon or even God
separating the light from the darkness to create the world.  Light, Darkness,
Order , Chaos, Male, Female, hero, dragon. We are creative and grow when we make
something unknown known or something unconscious conscious. These concepts and
symbols are so fundamental to us that we often don't realize they are there.  

Neumann goes to some pains to distinguish between the personal and
transpersonal.   I think he is refuting Freud here suggesting that Oedipal
complex is not about an individual's mother but a collective Great Mother. He
insists we begin in the transpersonal because the ego is a late development in
the human psyche. 
 
## Podcast conclusion I am passionate about learning about this fascinating
intersection of myth and psychology and I hope you will join me on this journey.
