# The Gods Within Episode One

## An review of Erich Neumann's "The Origins and History of Consciousness"

### How I got to this point and what am I doing here?

* In recent years I've become more and more fascinated with myth, Jungian
  psychology and their intersection.

* While researching these themes about 18 months ago I came across Jordan
  Peterson's video on YouTube on [Carl Jung and the Lion
  King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iLiKMUiyTI).  I was really wowed by his
  analysis of the movie and his ability to tie the themes of the movie to its
  underlying mythological and psychological themes. 

* To give you an idea in looking at the first scene of the movie, a sunrise, he
  ties the first seconds of the film to the rise of consciousness, connects the
  Lion's mane to the sun and solar gods/kings, the hero's journey to
  illuminating higher consciousness, and rebirth.

* I want to be able to understand and explain this symbolism myself and get to
  the bottom of if if I can. What's at the root of this? Is that question
  something we can even answer?

* That led me to starting many books by Jung, Marie Louis Von Franz and Erich
  Neumann, but I have found theses texts challenging.  Still,  the more I dive
  in; the more rewarding it becomes.  I'd like to share what I've learned with
  you.

Eventually I landed on Neumann - a student and then colleague of Jung. His "The
Origins and History of Consciousness" is such a fascinating book on so many
levels. Jungian's like Neumann have an understanding of human history and in
particular Western history and its influence on the individual that is more
comprehensive than anything I have seen. They can cut through thousands of years
of history and find the themes that still heavily influence us today.  I am also
fascinated with Jung's incorporation of myth into his work on the psyche and the
collective unconscious. I became even more interested in reading this book when
seeing Jung's forward where Jung states "if I were granted a second lease on
life I would start to ... sift out all those 'beginnings without continuation'
and knead them into a whole. This difficult and meritorious task the author has
performed with outstanding success."  It seems even Jung is suggesting this is
the book to read. Who am I to differ? 

As intriguing as I have found this book it is a difficult read.  I am an amateur
in the non-pejorative sense of the word - this is a labor of love.  Many popular
books like the Harry Potter and Game of Thrones series have podcasts where
podcasters go through a book chapter by chapter and offer analysis. I haven't
found such a resource as of it yet.  So the next best thing is to do this
myself.  This is an ambitious intellectual task and I hope the process will be
as enlightening for you as it is for me.


* Back to Peterson's interpretation of the Lion King.  I think he is
  interpreting the symbolism correctly or at least a correct interpretation. 

* The strange thing about symbols is we understand them at some level but they
  are very hard to explain verbally rationally.  Symbols stirs us but they are
  so hard to put our finger on.   Symbols often point to things we have
  consciously forgotten but are still there at an unconscious level so they
  affect us, stir us and move us. Jung said a symbol is "something more and
  other than itself which eludes our present knowledge." He also called it "the
  best possible formulation of a relatively unknown thing, which for that reason
  cannot be clearly or characteristically represented."  

* Symbols are at the core of of the psyche according to  Jungian psychology rich
  with visual information that can be interpreted in many often contradictory
  ways. 

* The etymology of the word symbol itself is a good example of this. 

* Jungian analyst Anthony Stevens in his book *Ariadne's Clue* explains
  symbolism as follows. It comes from the Greek word *symbolon* coming from
  *sym* which means together, and *ballein* which means to throw. Throw
  together. Often an object like a bone would be broken in two with each half
  being given to member's of a secret society. The two pieces could be united to
  create a match and establish identity. (This is how public key cryptography
  works at a high level in computing interestingly enough).  

* That is a great microcosm of Jung's model of the psyche. The collective
  unconscious sends messages via symbols to the conscious ego in an effort to
  compensate for something that is lacking. If the ego can understand and
  assimilate the message, the individual achieves higher consciousness and
  growth. Consciousness develops out of the unconscious in this way. Jung called
  this process individuation. Neumann in this book outlines what he sees as the
  stages of individuation based on mythological projections from the collective
  unconscious.

This is a good time to jump into Jung's model of the psyche which is essential
for understanding Neumann's work. If you are familiar with Jung and his work
this will be old hat for you. These concepts are covered in volumes of books but
I will try to give you just enough here to get started. 


## Jung's model of the Psyche

### Recommended reading or listening if you want more depth on Jung and his
model of the psyche.

I am relying heavily on two resources that I can recommend if you want to dive
deeper into Jung's model. Instead of just providing definitions of the parts of
the psyche in Jung's model I will try to give you an idea of the core concepts
and how they relate to one another.

[The Jung Podcast](https://jungian.libsyn.com/) and excellent introduction to
Jung's model of the psyche by Jon Betts a Canadian Jungian Analyst. 

[On Jung by Anthony
Stevens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/069101048X).


### The Onion Analogy
Stevens uses an analogy of an onion with 4 principle layers
to describe this model. The outer layer is the ego while the innermost layer is
called the Self. In between we have two layers of the unconscious: the personal
and the collective unconscious. 

### The Ego
The ego is what we call I or myself: our conscious existence. It is
in charge of stability of personality and identity over time as well as
cognition, daily executive function and reality testing. 

### The Self
The Self is the director of our lives across time.  Jung posits that
we are born with our potential defined and the Self guides us to the best
possible outcome given the environment we physically and psychologically inhabit
during our lives. Jungian Analyst Jon Betts refers to Jungian analyst and author
Andrew Samuels definition in his podcast:

“An archetypal image of man’s fullest potential and the unity of the personality
as a whole. The Self as a unifying principle within the human psyche occupies
the central position of authority in relation to psychological life and
therefore the destiny of the individual. At times Jung speaks of the Self as
initiatory of psychic life. At other times he refers to its realization as the
goal.” 

### The Ego Self Axis

 We begin life with a body and the Self. All that potential
is with us in the beginning as the Self - we are not blank slates according to
Jung. The Self is our blueprint, our potential. We then over the first half of
life build up our ego making it more and more powerful to enable us to interact
with and effect the world. At midlife just when we are at our most powerful we
may find ourselves in a funk or depression -  a midlife crisis.  In the Jungian
model, there is a teleological reason or a purpose for this. The Self is sending
us messages to have us pay more attention to the inner world, the unconscious,
and the riches to be found there. In this way we come back into balance along
the Ego Self axis. The depression has a compensatory function.


### The Personal Unconscious

The personal unconscious is made of complexes - which can be healthy or
unhealthy in the Jungian model.  A complex is a cluster of strong feelings
around a theme. We all have multiple complexes. 

Jon Betts cites the example of a money complex.  As children we realize money is
powerful as it allows us to either purchase something we desire or prevents us
from purchasing it due to lack of money. We might hear our parents argue over
money. As we become independent we might run out of money to pay bills as we
establish ourselves.  Later we might discover the importance of saving money or
investing for retirement. 

All these experiences and create a money complex.  Jung saw complexes as having
their own personalities that can overwhelm the ego (thus are unconscious) and
can take over for a time when triggered.  Jung said  “Everyone knows people have
complexes. What is more important is complexes have people.”  

Stevens puts it another way: "the personal unconscious is the product of the
interaction between the collective unconscious and the environment in which the
individual grows up." 

Becoming conscious of complexes and confronting them is the key method to
promoting the growth of personality and psychological health. Jung did say that
this is a difficult  even terrifying process, especially at first.

Jung thought there was a core or nuclear element to a complex. This element is
what he called archetypes of the collective unconscious. This nucleus of the
complex provides the surface area where a complex and an archetype touch an
individual.

### The Collective Unconscious

Just as the personal unconscious is composed of complexes the collective
unconscious consists of archetypes.

* Archetype on the first page of the introduction Neumann gives us a nice
  straight forward definition. "They (archetypes) are the pictorial forms of
  instincts, for the unconscious mind in images which as in dreams and
  fantasies, initiate the process of conscious reaction and assimilation."  Lets
  repeat this again: "They (archetypes) are the pictorial forms of instincts,
  for the unconscious mind in images which as in dreams and fantasies, initiate
  the process of conscious reaction and assimilation. " Conscious reaction and
  assimilation are the process of individuation which we will define shortly.

* Collective unconscious definition: A trans-personal or collective part of the
  psyche that has grown out of evolutionary experience that speaks to the ego in
  symbols or archetypes. We aren't blank slates but a "pre-programmed" with
  archetypal reactions to life situations we encounter, like falling in love,
  becoming a parent for example. Think of this as the psychological side of
  human evolution.

### Individuation
A process of individual increase in consciousness (perhaps
described emotional, spiritual and intellectual maturity and growth) by
surfacing complexes and archetypal images, wrestling with their significance,
and making them conscious thus promoting individual growth.

## Book Introduction

### Introduction to the Introduction
What is Neumann trying to accomplish in this book? We don't have to read far to
answer this question. In the first sentence of the introduction he states: "The
following attempt outline the archetypal stages of the development of
consciousness is based on modern depth psychology. It is an application of the
analytical psychology of C.J. Jung ..." (Depth psychology is defined as
those branches of psychology that take the unconscious into account
Freudian and Jungian psychology). 

The key word here is stages.  His theory outlines what he sees as the stages of
the development of consciousness.

Neumann emphasises that unlike other methods that look at environmental
factors in the development of consciousness, he is interested in the
internal, psychic, and archetypal factors in the development of
consciousness.

He calls archetypes the structural organs of the psyche, or pictorial
instincts. The unconscious uses these archetypes to reveal itself to the
conscious mind. Archetypes are then structural layers or organs of the
psyche. 

Neumann:  "It is the task of this book to show that a series of archetypes is
a main constituent of mythology, that they (archetypes) stand in stadial
succession in an organic relation to one another, and that their stadial
succession determines the growth of consciousness. In the course of its
ontogenetic (lifetime) development, the individual ego has to pass through the
same archetypal stages which determined the evolution of consciousness in the
life humanity. 

This idea of the individual repeating the stages of growth of the species
is an idea Jung took from Friedrich Nietzsche. Now all of this is quite
abstract, let's try to make it clearer.

What I think he is saying in this statement is that historically human
consciousness went through a series of stages of development. The individual in
his lifetime passes through these same stages as the species. These stages are
composed of archetypes - pictoral forms of instincts. We see these archetypes in
mythology. To the extent he can Neumann is trying to survey all of mythology and
determines its outlines.  In theses outlines he sees the stages of the
growth of consciousness of the individual and of humanity. He is
developing a theory.


### Stages of the Development of Consciousness
Passing through each stage, the ego transforms its relationship to the
archetypes. "The ability to perceive, to understand, and to interpret
these images is a process of succession in time, ..  it takes place in
stages." This ability to absorb unconscious contents improves at each
stage and leads to individual transformation and improvement. Jung called
this telos which means self-realization. At each stage the individual can
look at its relationship to these core archetypes with increasing wisdom
and light. It's as if we get another bite at the apple at each stage being
wiser and more conscious of the complexes and archetypes that influence us
in our actions.

In each of these stages we see the position of the individual (ego) in
relation to the symbolic feminine and masculine. The ego position shifts
in relation to the symbolic feminine and masculine at each stage. In the
beginning - the creation stage - the masculine and feminine are united and
the ego sees itself as indistinct from the unified masculine and feminine.
He calls this stage the uroboros. In the next stage, The Great Mother, the
masculine is diminished and the feminine dominates in largely a negative
connotation as it prevents the young ego from blossoming. As we proceed
through he next stages the ego becomes independent. These stages are  the
separation of the world parents, the birth of the hero, the slaying of the
mother (or the dragon fight), the slaying of the father and finally the
captive and the treasure and the transformation or Osiris. The symbol
then in the final stage is the mandala where unity is again achieved but
the individual now joins in the embrace of the symbolic feminine and
masculine as a conscious participant.

We can get a feel for these stages composed of archetypes by just examining the
section titles of the book. We will do a podcast episode about each of these.


A. The Creation Myth 
	I. The Uroborous
	II. The Great Mother
	III. The Seperation of of World Parents: The Principle of Opposites

B. The Hero Myth
	I. The Birth of the Hero II.
	The Slaying of the Mother
	III. The Slaying of the Father

C. The Transformation Myth
	I. The Captive and the Treasure
	II. Transformation or Osiris


Each of these stages is a chapter in  the book and will have one or
podcasts dedicated to them.  

Human consciousness has absorbed more and more unconscious contents over
thousands of years and in this process expands its own frontiers. Neumann
suggests that in the West consciousness has achieved continuity where each
stage is integrated. According to Neumann modern consciousness sits on
this integration.

Now when he says West this includes ancient Babylon and Egypt. I am really
excited to get into this aspect of the book because its absolutely fascinating.
He ties the myths like those of Marduk (Babylon), Osiris (Egypt), and Christ
together as themes that are the  basis for development of society and
consciousness.  This is that ability to look under the current of history and
see the themes that still influence us today that make Neumann so compelling.

Why is this podcast called The Gods Within? For Neumann that which was projected
outward the gods is still with us in our psyches due to the influence of the
collective unconscious.  The collective unconscious is the deeper layer of
humanity that each of us is connected to.  Consciousness is a late evolutionary
product and the collective unconscious came first. Throughout human history and
pre-history symbols were projected outward as powerful forces or gods. These
same symbols and archetypes determine individual psychic growth as well.

Neumann states "The integration of these collective symbols leads to the further
development of the psyche and synthesis of the personality  thus it has a
therapeutic aim as well. In this process the psyche expands leading to new
solutions and new problems which trigger the whole process again. The collective
human aspect is rediscovered and begins to come alive, new insights, new
possibilities of life add themselves to the narrowly personalistic and
rigid personality of the sick-souled modern man."  
The development of consciousness from the unconscious in myth is the focus of the
first half of the book while the second half focuses on the internalization of
these myths into the individual psyche.
 
## Podcast conclusion

Going back to the idea of symbols being part recognizable and at the same
time part unrecognizable, we see that Neumann illuminates an understanding
of these symbols in our collective and individual psyches.  Understanding
them is understanding ourselves.  Us moderns have forgotten how to think
symbolically and we need to remember.  I am passionate about learning
about this fascinating and tantalizing intersection of myth and psychology
and I hope you will join me on this journey. As we progress through the
podcast we will use use movies, myths and fairy tales to make these
concepts less abstract and more relatable. Subscribe.
