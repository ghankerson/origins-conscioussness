# The Ego Under the Dominance of the Uroboros

* When the ego begins to emerge from the uroboros and breaks the embryonic
  connection, it takes up a new attitude in the world. The variation of
  the myth, gods, symbols and archetypes are the expression but also the
  instrument of this change.  This means being detached from uroboros and
  born into the lower world of reality full of danger, discomfort, and the
  ego is aware of pain and pleasure. The world becomes ambivalent. 
 
* Nature (the uroboros) is unconscious and combines meaningful creation
  with meaningless destruction.

* The wicked, devouring mother and the good mother are the two sides of
  the uroboric Mother Goddess who reign over this psychic stage.

* The growing ambivalence give rise to an equally ambivalent attitude
  toward the archetype in whose power it lies.

* The overwhelming might of the unconscious is seen as the evil mother
  the goddess of death, famine, plague flood and the sweetness that leads
  to destruction.  In contrast the good mother is the dispenser of life
  and the womb of cornucopia who provides an image of resurrection, rebirth
  and new life.

* Against all this the ego/individual remains small and weak.
  Consciousness has not yet established a firm foothold in the ocean of
  the unconscious. The ego is defenseless against this maelstrom of
  a mysterious being who bombards the ego from within and without.

* Early man's life has a feeling of constant endangerment as danger and
  uncertainty are everywhere. The external world of famine and flood is
  projected as demons. The inner world is inhabited by these demons as
  witches, monsters, and magicians whose invisible workings manifest as
  emotional outburst, lust, murderous impulses, visions and
  hallucinations. Fear rules - we haven't rid ourselves of this today.

* The same horrors are known to the child who is largely unconscious and
  confronts every event as a devastating innovation exposed to every whim
  of the world and man.  The combination of the dread of the horrors of
  the outside world combined with inside world made mysterious by
  projection. This creates an animalistic and dynamistic world view.

* This dread is an expression of the small, feeble ego pit against the
  cosmos.

* For this reason fear is a normal phenomenon for a child. It is
  eventually outgrown but also provides an incentive for for growth. The
  ability to articulate fear helps overcome it so it is wrong to seek to
  get rid of fear in this way.

* Pleasure and pain are still somewhat combined as opposites are not yet
  well distinguished. The non-separation of opposites and the resultant
  ambivalence of the ego towards all objects evoke fear and feelings of
  impotence. The world is uroboric and supreme whether this is experienced
  as world, one's environment or one's body.

* This is the age of the matriarchate as Bachofen describes it. This is
  a structural stage of the psyche not a historical one. 

* In men and women consciousness has a masculine character. Consciousness
  = light = day  while unconsciousness = darkness and night.

* Bachofen's matriarchate stage is where the ego conscious is undeveloped
  and still embedded in nature and the world. Thus the uroboric principle
  is associated with of earth and vegetation symbolism. Marriage is an
  agrarian matter filled with agricultural symbolism.

* Plato in Menexenus: *In fertility and generation, woman does not set an
  example to the earth, but the earth sets an example ot woman.*

* Food symbolism is key at this stage as the Mother Goddess cultures and
  myths connect food symbolism with fertility and, growth and agriculture.
  
* The uroboros at this stage is maternal as it characterized by the
  child's relationship to the mother who provides nourishment but at the
  same time occurs during a historical period where man is most dependent
  on the earth and nature. 

* The sequence child-man-ego-consciousness is dependent on
  mother-earth-nature-unconscious and vice-versa. 

* In this stage the divine mother and the helpless child are emphasized.
