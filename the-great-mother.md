# The Ego Under the Dominance of the Uroboros

* When the ego begins to emerge from the uroboros and breaks the embryonic
  connection, it takes up a new attitude in the world. This means being
  born into the lower world of reality full of danger, discomfort, and the
  ego is aware of pain and pleasure. The world becomes ambivalent. 
 
* Nature is unconscious and combines meaningful creation with meaningless
  destruction.

* The wicked, devouring mother and the good mother are the two sides of
  the uroboric Mother Goddess who reign over this psychic stage.
