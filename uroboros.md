# The Creation Myth and the Uroboros

Neumann's primary thesis is that consciousness in the individual repeats the developmental stages of humanity. Whenever we speak of creation of the world, we are talking about the birth of the individual psyche. When we talk about the hero slaying the dragon, we are talking about the development of the individual psyche out of the collective unconscious. As Neumann states:
	... in every individual life, consciousness re-experiences its emergence from the unconscious in the growth of childhood,
	and every night in sleep, dying with the sun, it sinks back into the depths of the unconscious, to be reborn in the morning
	and begin the day anew.
*Page 18*

This book is all myth, symbols and archetypes. Neumann describes symbols as coming from the collective unconscious and they are not logical or rationale. To understand symbols we have to know that they are metaphor. Symbols can contain rich and even contradictory images. The symbols Neumann finds around creation are symbols of perfection: the round, a circle as it is self-contained without beginning or end:
	 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last."
*Revelations 22:13 King James Bible* 

Since symbols are rich, heavy and contradictory, they are best understood by circling around them, examining them from many angles. In fact an archetype is a series or constellation of symbols around a topic. Related symbols for creation include the World Egg, the world parents locked in perpetual embrace, the Chinese T'ai Chi illustrates this as well being a dark and a light half of a circle each containing a spec of its opposite. The T'ai Chi is really the same thing symbolically  as the World Parents, Heaven and Earth melded together, the symbolic masculine and feminine fused together. 

The symbol Neumann lands on as his primary metaphor for creation myth stage of the development of consciousness is the Uroboros. The Uroboros is an Egyptian symbol for a cosmic creature that slays, weds and impregnates itself. A common visual symbol for the uroboros is a snake eating its tail. It is seen in myths of Egypt, India, Babylon, Rome, Navajo, Mexico and even in the Revelation of St. John.  

The uroboros first appears in the Egyptian Book of the Dead around 1600 B.C.E as the self-creating god Atum rose from primordial waters in the figure of a snake renewing himself every morning [Crystalinks](https://www.crystalinks.com/ouroboros.html).

What is so "illogical" about these symbols is they do mean the beginning and the end, plenitude and nothingness, birth, life, death and resurrection all at the same time.

##Sub-stages in the first stage of consciousness
Neumann presents three sub-stages to this first stage in the development of consciousness. He calls them stages of uroboric autacracy (autacracy in this case is akin to dominance or rule). 

###The Pleromatic Stage
This first stage he describes as "the pleromatic (divine plenitude)  stage of paradisal perfection in the unborn, the embryonic stage of the ego, which a later consciousness will contrast with suffering of the non-autacratic ego in the world."

This needs some unpacking. This first sub-stage is before consciousness, before ego and before history. Since it is before it is a virtual or a priori stage. The analogy here is like the child in the womb of its mother. The mother or the womb provides all, and in fact there is no distinction between child and mother or ego and world. It is paradisal as all is provided for and there is no suffering. "An embryonic ego still undeveloped germ of ego consciousness slumbers in the perfect round." 


Neumann quotes Plato as an example in this example:
	Therefore the demuriege made the world in the shape of a sphere, giving it that figure which of all is the most perfect
	and equal of itself.  

He also cites Lao-tzu on again the t'ai chi:
	There was something formless yet complete,
	That existed before heaven and earth,
	Without sound, without substance,
	Depending on nothing, unchnaging,
	All pervading, unfailing,
	One may think of it as the mother of all things under heaven.

The round or uroboros can also be interpreted as the World Parents - the union of feminine and masculine opposites in perpetual embrace. From Babylonian myth:
	When on high the heaven had not been named
	Firm ground below had not been called by name,
	Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter,
	(And) Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all,
	Their waters comingling as a single body.

####Creation or Birth
So while the World Parents present a picture of static pre-history - the perpetual embrace, we need a related but perhaps contradictory symbol for birth.  Since the uroboros is in part the beginning, birth, creation, or the wheel that rolls itself we find myths of self-impregnating gods (pro)creating without a partner.  In Egyptian theology the god Atum procreates by himself. From the Egyptian Pyramid Text:

	In the beginning there was nothing (Nun). A mound of earth rose from Nun and upon it Atum created himself.
	He spat Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture) from his mouth. 
	Atum’s two offspring became separated from him and lost in the dark nothingness,
	so Atum sent his “Eye” to look for them.
	When they were found, he named Shu as “life” and Tefnut as “order” and entwined them together.	
[Ancient Egypt Online](https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/atum/).

In other versions of the Egyptian creation myth Atum create offspring via masturbation. From the book of Apopis:
	Atum, who indulged himself in Heliopolis, took his phalis in his hand to arouse pleasure,
	a brohter and sister were produced Shu and Tefnut.

Neumann notes how this kind of creation myth becomes more sophisticated over time and leans into the idea of spiritualization or inspiration. Hindi myths express how thinking and introversion are the equivalent of emitting heat a creative force:

	He found foothold on the earth. When he had found a firm foothold there, he thought:
	I will propagate myself. He emitted heat and became pregnant.

Thought, and introversion become spirit and later in Christianity the Logos:
	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
	John 1:1	

Neumann states that even the Logos still hints at the uroboric idea of the self-manifesting god.   

 
####Death or Uroboric Incest
Neumann notes that the natural impulse of the pleromatic stage is not for consciousness to bubble up, but for the ego to return to a restful state in the uroboros. He calls this "uroboric incest" or and entry back into the mother (womb). As the nascent ego sparks into existence it's tendency is to return to unity with the mother. There is no pleasure or sexual meaning here. Neumann describes this as "passively letting oneself being taken". We can see how this image could be associated with longing, nostalgia, depression or even suicidal ideation. This is a negative reflection of the *hierros gamos* or sacred marriage (union of heaven and earth) that can occur in later stages of consciousness development. Since uroboric incest is a return to the mother or earth it is a kind of death that can be symbolized by a tomb, sarcophagus, cave, coffin or sunset. As the symbolism of the uroboros suggests the ego or child is then reborn at sunrise.


###The Alimentary Uroboros
The second sub-stage he calls the alimentary uroboros. The symbolism here focuses on consumption of food or prey and bodily output as birth. The serpent consumes its own waste as food and thus recreates itself. This creates the circle or ring that binds.
