# The Creation Myth and the Uroboros

## Symbol vs. Symbol Group

We talked about symbols in the previous podcast. Symbols are key to
Jungian psychology and to this book  so let's review them for a moment.

We understand symbols at some level but they are very hard to explain
verbally rationally.  Symbols stirs us but they are so hard to put our
finger on. Symbols often point to things we have consciously forgotten
but are still there at an unconscious level so they affect us, stir us
and move us. Jung said a symbol is "something more and other than itself
which eludes our present knowledge." He also called it "the best
possible formulation of a relatively unknown thing, which for that
reason cannot be clearly or characteristically represented."  

Symbols are at the core of of the psyche according to Jungian psychology rich
with visual information that can be interpreted in many often contradictory
ways. 

Symbols and images are not rational statements and do not hold up to logic.
Rather they surround an idea describing it from many sides. The psyche works
in symbols not logic. The psyche looks at the question of the beginning and
asks "Where did I come from or Whence?" It is the same question for the
individual and the world. 

The answers all come symbolically from deep in the psyche: the unconscious.
The psyche blends and weaves ideas together even if they are contradictory.
Symbolic meaning is rich but elusive. It contains something conscious and
familiar and something unconscious and out of reach.

This book is all myth, symbols and archetypes. Neumann describes symbols as
coming from the collective unconscious and they are not logical or rationale. To
understand symbols we have to know that they are metaphor. Symbols can contain
rich and even contradictory images. The symbols Neumann finds around creation
are symbols of perfection: the round, a circle as it is self-contained without
beginning or end: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
the last." *Revelations 22:13 King James Bible* 

Since symbols are rich, heavy and contradictory, they are best understood by
circling around them, examining them from many angles. In fact an archetype is a
series or constellation of symbols around a topic. Related symbols for creation
include the World Egg, the world parents locked in perpetual embrace, the
Chinese T'ai Chi illustrates this as well being a dark and a light half of a
circle each containing a spec of its opposite. The T'ai Chi is really the same
thing symbolically  as the World Parents, Heaven and Earth melded together, the
symbolic masculine and feminine fused together. 
Neumann says "The symbol is therefore an analogy, more of an equivalence
than an equation, and therein lies its wealth of meanings, but also its
elusiveness" (pg. 8).

## Symbol Group
A symbol group around an idea however can make something unknown more
capable of becoming conscious. With a symbol group we can circe around
this group and examine it from many angles to acheive greater
understanding and integration.Here Neumann's efforts to make a survey of
all mythology looking for common threads really pays off. He finds
patterns and stages of the development of consciousness in these symbol
groups common throughout myth and dreams as the symbols come from the
unconscious.

At each stage of the development of consciousness we find a symbol group.
He finds the symbol group for the first stage in the development of
consciousness includes symbols such as the womb, the world parents, the
circle, the great hermaphrodite, the egg, the sphere, the united
opposites, and others. All these symbols are interchangeable. The symbol
group in these myths are universal as they appear in Egypt, New Zealand,
Greece, Africa and India.

Let's explore this symbol group with a few and look at some examples from
mythology. Here we are largely talking about the mythology of creation.

One example is the T'ai C'hi containing black and white, day and night,
male and female. This symbol is half black and half white each half
containing a smaller circle with the opposite color inside it so the white
half has a small white circle and vice-versa. Here the emphasis is on the
absence of the opposites, conflict and history. Everything is still
unified.

*There was something formless yet complete, That existed before heaven and
earth, Without sound sound, without substance Dependent on nothing, unchanging
All pervading, unfailing One may think of it as the mother of all things under
heaven.* *Tao Teh Ching*

The Hindu *purusha* combines the poles or the opposites and is the primal
creative element

*In the beginning the world was Soul (Atman) alone in the form of a person.
Looking around he saw nothing else than himself. He said first: "I am." He
was, indeed, as large as a woman and a man closely embraced. He caused that
self to fall (pat) into two pieces. Therefrom arose a husband and a wife.*

Similarly, Plato in Timaeus writes:

*And he established the universe a sphere revolving in a circle, one and
solitary, yet by reason of its excellence able to bear himself company, and
needing no other friendship or aquaintance.*

There are many aspects to this symbol group or archetype. It is very difficult
to make sense of from a logical standpoint so we need to circle around it and
view it from many angles to make sense of the multiple aspects and
contradictions in this symbol group.


##  The Uroboros

The uroboros first appears in the Egyptian Book of the Dead around 1600 B.C.E as
the self-creating god Atum rose from primordial waters in the figure of a snake
renewing himself every morning
[Crystalinks](https://www.crystalinks.com/ouroboros.html).

This circular snake or dragon that bites its own tale is the self-begetting
uroboros of which the Egyptians say "it slays, it weds, and impregnates
itself". This is the primary symbol Neumann lands on for this first stage.

The uroboros is full of contradictory opposites man and woman, giving birth
and slaying to end life it is active and passive above and below all at once.

The uroboros is known to ancient Babylon, the Mandaeans, the Phoenicians,
Egyptians, in the Revelation of St. John, the Gnostics, the Navajo, Mexico and
India.

Today the concepts around the symbol of the uroboros are difficult for us to
grasp. It is all and it is nothing. It is wholeness and unity as well as
non-differentiation or the absence of opposites. The modern mind only sees
this as paradox but symbols and images can contain this contradiction and
still be whole. 

Even though the uroboros symbol group emphasizes the union of the opposites --
the symbolic male and symbolic female -- the feminine or masculine aspects of
the uroboros can be still be discerned and emphasized. It is not that the
opposites do not exist at this stage, but that they are united.

The round or uroboros can also be interpreted as the World Parents - the union
of feminine and masculine opposites in perpetual embrace. From Babylonian myth:
*When on high the heaven had not been named Firm ground below had not been
called by name, Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter, (And) Mummu-Tiamat,
she who bore them all, Their waters comingling as a single body.*


## The Stages of Uroboric Autarchy

When Neumann speaks of uroboric autacracy he is simply saying the uroboros
is dominating over the ego at this stage. 

### The Pleromatic Stage
#### Introduction

This first stage he describes as "the pleromatic" (divine plenitude) stage
of paradisal perfection in the unborn, the embryonic stage of the ego,
which a later consciousness will contrast with suffering of the
non-autacratic ego in the world."

This needs some unpacking. This first sub-stage is before consciousness, before
ego and before history. Since it is before it is a virtual or a priori stage.
The analogy here is like the child in the womb of its mother. The mother or the
womb provides all, and in fact there is no distinction between child and mother
or ego and world. It is paradisal as all is provided for and there is no
suffering. "An embryonic ego still undeveloped germ of ego consciousness
slumbers in the perfect round." 

In the beginning is perfection and wholeness. The beginning though is a
virtual stage that cannot be described rationally but only symbolically.

As soon as the rational mind tries grab on to this idea of the beginning plus
end, creation plus destruction, the idea slips through the fingers. For this
reason a symbol stands at the beginning. 

The beginning can be seen as two places the birth of the world and of the
individual. 

The beginning projects itself mythologically as the beginning of the world.
These myths begin with the world because in this virtual stage there is no
separation between the world and the individual psyche. The individual psyche
is "knows itself as the world and in the world experiences the its own
becoming as world becoming, its own images as the starry heavens and its own
contents as the world-creating gods."

In virtually all myths creation is the creation of light which is symbolically
consciousness. Consciousness as light in contrast to the darkness of the
unconscious is the real object of creation mythology.

Before the light we still have the virtual stage of creation which precedes
the light is surrounded by a series of symbols. 


#### The Maternal Uroboros

One aspect of the uroboros is the part that encircles or contains. This aspect
is seen primarily as maternal.  Human consciousness at this stage is nascent
and under the dominance of the uroboros. Remember that for Neumann the ego sees
itself differently in each stage of consciousness. The ego still sees itself
as the world and the world as itself. The initial stage of the infantile ego is
marked by the predominance of the maternal side of the uroboros.

In this stage the world is all embracing and the ego tires easily and sinks
back into the embrace of the Great Mother.  

The Great Mother in this stage has all the positive maternal attributes:
nourishing, sheltering, protecting, warmth, comfort, and forgiveness. It is an
image of paradise that cannot be realized in adult life.

The Garden of Eden is a great example of maternal aspect of the uroboros. The
walled garden encircles, protects, provides and nourishes.

The Great and Good Mother embody this stage of the uroboros and are not seen
again until a much later stage of development where she returns as the
wise Sophia as the wise "Mother of All Living". In subsequent stages the
feminine aspect appears as the terrible or devouring mother.


##### Uroboric Incest

Neumann notes that the natural impulse of the pleromatic stage is not for
consciousness to bubble up, but for the ego to return to a restful state in the
uroboros. He calls this "uroboric incest" or and entry back into the mother
(womb). As the nascent ego sparks into existence it's tendency is to return to
unity with the mother. There is no pleasure or sexual meaning here. Neumann
describes this as "passively letting oneself being taken". We can see how this
image could be associated with longing, nostalgia, depression or even suicidal
ideation. This is a negative reflection of the *hierros gamos* or sacred
marriage (union of heaven and earth) that can occur in later stages of
consciousness development. Since uroboric incest is a return to the mother or
earth it is a kind of death that can be symbolized by a tomb, sarcophagus,
cave, coffin or sunset. As the symbolism of the uroboros suggests the ego or
child is then reborn at sunrise.

As long as the ego is weak the downward drag toward unconsciousness is felt as
pleasure and safety while ego consciousness is felt as heavy and weak. As long
as this holds the ego submits to the uroboros.

Neumann calls this downward drag uroboric incest. It is not incest in the
sexual sense but a symbol of return to unconscious. He also calls it
a precursor to the hierros gamos (sacred marriage) which comes later with the
hero reunifying with the round which is a mandala in the later stage. 

Uroboric incest is a form of re-entry to the mother or to the unconscious. It
is a desire to be dissolved and absorbed and is pleasureful. The Great Mother
takes the child back into herself. Symbols associated with uroboric incest
include the cave, the earth, tomb, coffin, urn and sarcophagus. The signia of
death is associated with uroboric incest.

This death however is seen as pleasurable an reunion with the Great Mother
who is all providing.


### The Stage of the Alimentray Uroboros

#### Body Symbolism
* In the uroboric stage we also have body symbolism belly = instinct, breast and
  heart = feeling,  and head and rain = spirit or thought.

* The body scheme is the archetype of the original man in whose image the world
  has been created. 
   
* Ancient man's fear of magical influence because every part of the body can
  stand for the body as the whole. In creation symbolism any bodily output is
  creative: semen, feces, spit breath, words, and urine. The world is created
  from all of it.

* The child emphasizes the visceral region. For the Greeks the midriff was the
  seat of consciousness. For the Egyptians and Indians the heart was the seat.
  In both cases thought is bound up with emotion - they are not yet separate.
  The heart is also the center of ethical decision-making. The intestinal
  processes of the alimentary track are lover and more fundamental. A sated
  person acts differently than and hungry one. The infantile ego sees the
  maternal uroboros as the source of food and satisfaction.

#### Food Symbolism

The symbolism here focuses on consumption of food or prey and bodily
output as birth. The serpent consumes its own waste as food and thus recreates
itself. This creates the circle or ring that binds.

The uroboros is call the tail-eater and this early stage is dominated by
the symbol of the alimentary canal. The strong eat the weak and the weak
are eaten by the strong. Hunger is the primer mover not sex.
 
Eating = intake, birth = output food (later speech). Life
= power = food.

Food symbolism as cosmic content where the uroboros consumes food in its
destructive aspect (destructive in order to be creative).  This is the
uroboros as the tail-eater. From Sanskrit (Indian) myth:

*From food all creatures are produced, All creatures that dwell on earth. By
food they live And into food they finally pass. Food is the chief among
beings. Therfore they call it the panacea. Verily he obtains all food. Who
worhships Brahma as food. For food is the chief among beings. Therefore they
call it a panacea. All creatures are born of food. By food they continue to
grow. Creatures feed on it, it upon creatures, Therefore it is called food. 

Brahma arises through tapas. From Brahma comes food. From food-breath,
spirit, truth,  Worlds, and in works, immortality.*

We can see the uroboros in creative and destructive modes. It creates
food of itself, to feed itself, destroy itself and recreate itself - and
infinite loop. The destruction or eating can be seen as a sacrifice to
the gods.

We still have vestiges of these ideas in phrases we use today:
      * "He is consumed by his work"
      * "A consuming disease"
      * "Eaten up with jealousy"
      * "Death's maw"
      * "A devouring war"

Vedic myth:
*Whatever he brought fort, he resolved to eat. Because he eats
everything he is called infinite.  Therefore he who knows the essence of
aditi, becomes the eater of the world; everything becomes food for
him.*

The act of eating or inwardly digesting means to having possessing and
having power over it.  Conscious realization is eating. 

This is expressed in Indian, Egyptian, and Christian myth. Liquor,
body and blood of Christ in communion). Psychologically, the outside
content is experienced internally. Eating becomes conscious assimilation
of content.

The maternal aspect of the uroboros looms over all of this food
symbolism. Need is hunger and satisfaction is satiety. He calls this
a pre-genital stage. To be satisfied is to eat. To express or to speak
means to excrete or spit at this stage.  

The bodily functions symbolizes a psychological process as well.
Consuming the gods is a spiritual act. The ingestion of this content
produces a change. Transformation of cells through food intake is
a basic change experienced by man.  A hungry, weak man can be
transformed into a satisfied and strong one through consuming food.



### The Genital-Masturbatory Stage (The Self Creating God and the Logos)

#### The Paternal Uroboros - the Creative Spark and the Logos
So while the World Parents present a picture of static
pre-history - the perpetual embrace, we need a related but perhaps contradictory
symbol for birth.  Since the uroboros is in part the beginning, birth, creation,
or the wheel that rolls itself we find myths of self-impregnating gods
(pro)creating without a partner.  In Egyptian theology the god Atum procreates
by himself. From the Egyptian Pyramid Text:

*In the beginning there was nothing (Nun). A mound of earth rose from Nun
and upon it Atum created himself.  He spat Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture)
from his mouth.  Atum’s two offspring became separated from him and lost
in the dark nothingness, so Atum sent his “Eye” to look for them.  When
they were found, he named Shu as “life” and Tefnut as “order” and entwined
them together.*	[Ancient Egypt
Online](https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/atum/).

In other versions of the Egyptian creation myth Atum create offspring via
masturbation. From the book of Apopis: *Atum, who indulged himself in
Heliopolis, took his phalis in his hand to arouse pleasure, a brohter and sister
were produced Shu and Tefnut.*

Neumann notes how this kind of creation myth becomes more sophisticated over
time and leans into the idea of spiritualization or inspiration. Hindi myths
express how thinking and introversion are the equivalent of emitting heat a
creative force:

	*He found foothold on the earth. When he had found a firm foothold
	there, he thought: I will propagate myself. He emitted heat and became
	pregnant.*

Thought, and introversion become spirit and later in Christianity the Logos: *In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.*
John 1:1	

Neumann states that even the Logos still hints at the uroboric idea of the
self-manifesting god. 

The paternal side of the uroboros is the procreative thrust that kicks
everything off including the evolution of time. Neumann notes that this is
harder to visualize than the maternal side of the uroboros. It does sound
quite strange to us as modern humans. Take these examples from Egyptian
mythology.

From the Book of Apopis: *I copulated in my hand. I joined myself with my
shadow and spurted out of my own mouth. I spewed forth as Shu and spat forth
as Tefnut*

From Pyramid Texts: *Atum, who indulged himself in Heliopolis, took his
phallus in order to arouse pleasure. A brother and sister were produced, Shu
and Tefnut.*

This is a symbol of the creative beginning. The paternal side of the uroboros
creates a brother and a sister by joining himself with this shadow or opposite
(the feminine).  He calls this the image of the self-fecundating primal god.
Neumann suggests then that this image is better crystallized later in new
variations of these myths where the image moves towards spiritualization.
These examples help us understand the idea further. Keep in mine that the
Egyptian hieroglyphs for thought is the heart and speech is the tongue.

*It is the heart (thought) which makes all that results come out, and it is the
tongue which repeats (expresses) the thought of the heart... That is what
causes the gods to be born. Atum with his Ennead, and every divine utterance
manifests itself in the the thought of the heart and the speech of the tongue.*

Finally more refined: *He did not bring me forth from his mouth, nor
conceive me in his hand, but he breathed me forth from his nostrils.*
Creation moves from being symbolized as thought and speech to breath.

This is all still from Egyptian myth but we are already at the point where the
"breath of life" is very similar to the idea of the Christian Logos.  

*"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God"*

Neumann suggests the expression of the Logos in the Bible never broke
completely from the idea of the self-fecundating, self-manifesting god.

The action of creation is anthropomorphized. Creation happens by thought first
and then speech. In Indian mythology this is expressed as follows:

*He, Prajapati, took to praying and fasting, because he desired offspring, and
he made himself fruitful.*

Here we again have the paternal self-fecundating god who reproduces via prayer
and fasting - similar to thought and speech.

In Indian myth we have heat being expressed as thought for creation:

*In the beginning the world was nothing at all. Heaven was not, nor earth, nor
space. Because it was not, it bethought itself: I will be. It emitted heat.*



## The Womb and the World Parents
* The mythological stages of the evolution of consciousness starts with the ego
  contained in the unconscious and leads up to the ego becoming self aware and
  defending itself. Finally the ego is able to broaden its horizons. 

* The first stage is the creation myth which consist of birth, suffering and
  emancipation and is projected as the mythology of creation. 

* When the world parents finally separate, the young ego asserts itself. At this
  stage humanity becomes self-aware.

* 
* The beginning has a common symbol in a circle. Its allies are a sphere, and
  egg and the round of alchemy. All of symbols in this group  are self-contained
  without beginning or end. Without history, time, space or consciousness. All
  this comes with the light which is "under the sway of the unmanifest godhead
  whose symbol is the circle."

* It is the beginning because the opposites are still united; the world parents
  are in perpetual embrace, and it is the end because the opposites have united
  again bringing the world to rest. 

* The world parents are united and thus are male and female: the great
  hermaphrodite.

* The World Parent or Heaven and Earth lying on top of one another united
  timelessly.  This again is the great hermaphrodite that contains the
  masculine and the feminine.

* The perfection that rests in itself in no way contradicts the perfection which
  encircles itself.  The part that encircles is static, eternal and unchanging
  while the center is the germ cell of creativity - the potential for forward
  momentum.

* The symbols of our past are still alive today in the individual psyche, in
  dreams and fantasies.  As long as humanity exists the circle will be a symbol
  of perfection: the primal deity that is sufficient unto itself and the self
  that has gone beyond the opposites will appear as the mandala. 

* The embryonic ego sleeps in the round and wakes up. The ego will later call
  this prenatal time.  The time before the separation of the opposites where
  there is still no consciousness. There is not time or history or space but
  eternity and infinity.

* The question of "Whence?" has one answer - the round  and two interpretations:
  the womb and the parents.  

* Neumann states "It is crucial for every psychology, and especially for every
  psychology of childhood to understand this problem and its symbolism.

* The uroboros appears as the womb but also as the masculine and feminine in
  perpetual union - the World Parents. The later is a symbol of the creation of
  the world not sexual. It is concerned with the origin of life, the spirit and
  the soul.  These are symbols of the collective unconscious not of the ego.

* Ancient people did not understand these themes consciously but they created
  myths around these themes. Mythology being a product of the collective
  unconscious shows us these themes of the uroboros via myth and symbol that are
  from the collective unconscious.

* Many ancient cultures did not even recognize the connection between sex
  and birth. We just come from the womb (the virgin birth)  and so the
  round of mythology is a symbolic womb - a place of origin from whence we
  come and not just a individual where we are from but a collective place
  where many unconscious contents lie waiting to be born.  Its not a womb
  or a mother but Wombs or Mothers.

* Symbols in this group include anything deep, an abyss, a valley, ground, the
  sea, fountains, lakes pools the earth, the underworld, caves, a house and the
  city. Anything big and embracing that preserves, wraps and nourishes belong to
  this group of symbols. 

* This state of perfection and contentment was never a historical one but is
  a psychological one and we just see the outlines of it. This state has
  a downward drag toward unconsciousness that is a natural force in the psyche.
  The counteracting force of a drive toward consciousness is the force that
  requires effort and striving (The Hero's Journey). The struggle between the
  specifically human and the universally natural constitutes the history of
  man's conscious development as ancient man continuously had to confront nature
  to survive. 

* He equates nostalgia and drunkenness as forms of uroboric incest. It is
  self-surrender associated with an infant ego or a sick ego unable to
  individuate further. Its can even be a tired, old ego creeping back to the
  mother after finding fulfillment.
	
* The infant ego does not experience uroboric incest as hostile even though it
  will be annihilated. It experiences this as a return to innocence, safety and
  pleasure - a form of rebirth.

* So far we have addresses the maternal aspect of the uroboros, but there is
  also the paternal aspect. The world parents is another image for the answer
  "Where do I come from?" At the stage of the uroboros the world parents are
  still locked in perpetual embrace. Mother and father, heaven and earth, God
  and world are still one. There are not yet any opposites.

* The world parents are a symbol of everlasting life. They are the great
  hermaphrodite and the place from which everything springs. They are the force
  that begets, conceives, births itself, kills and revivifies. It a symbol of
  the place beyond opposites but also a place of new beginning: "The Wheel that
  rolls itself."

* Neumann notes that the creation myth and the uroboros can emphasize the
  masculine or the feminine.  Creation can happen with either. Sexual symbolism
  alone cannot express the idea of creation of the world from nothing  so an
  image or symbol of the uroboros shows male and female together - the world
  parents - both capable of creation. There is no differentiation of the
  opposites in this stage. It is the before before the before.
  
* The creative force is expressed as the creative word, the creative breath but
  is just an abstraction of the procreative wind, spirit or inspiration.
  Neumann notes: this wind is the fructifying bird, the solar phallus, that
  blows and makes fertile.

* The One who stands at the beginning is the creative force of the World
  Parents from whom the creative inspiration blows, begets, gives birth, moves,
  breaths and speaks.

#### Preconscious and Post conscious Knowledge
* Even though the ego experiences the uroboros as dark unconscious power there
  is still a sense if it as extra-worldly knowledge that is acquired before
  birth or after death. 
   
* In the Tibetan Book of the Dead the dead receive instruction which culminates
  in knowledge that he shall know himself as the white light beyond life and
  death. 

* This is post-conscious knowledge but also pre-conscious knowledge. The Jewish
  midrash says that over the head of a unborn babe there is a light that burns
  and sees all the ends of the world. The unborn is still a part of the primal
  ocean or uroboros - beginning and end - alpha and omega. In some myths
  creatures come up from the sea and impart wisdom from this realm.

* The ring of life and death is a closed circuit. The dead man instructed in the
  Tibetan Book of the Dead will be born again in this wheel of life.
   
* Some ancient or traditional societies treat children with great respect
  because they are closer to this pre-conscious wisdom. Neumann calls this
  transpersonal knowledge. The child is the ancestor reborn.

* Jung said that Psychologically the collective unconscious is the repository of
  ancestral experience so the child is the carrier of this experience and the is
  the symbolic ancestor.






## The Maternal Uroboros and Transition
* The symbolism of the uroboric stages does not represent a return to oral
  fixation in a Piagetian sense but rather a total surrender to the
  unconscious. Neumann called this uroboric incest earlier. 

* The maternal aspect of the alimentary	stage then emphasizes the breasts
  but they are generative elements in the sense they fertilize the young.
  The breasts may even have a phallic aspect in the uroboric stage as the
  maternal uroboros is still hermaphroditic.  Birth is by evacuating in
  line with other food symbolism of this stage. 

* The emphasis on the breast and its phallic character starts to denote
  a transition. Originally in the uroboros the ego is contained completely
  but when the phallic character of the breast emerges, the Mother is seen
  as the phallus bearer and the infantile subject is starting to
  differentiate itself. Active and passive striving become distinct.
  Conceiving by eating and giving birth by excreting become distinct. The
  opposites begin to emerge.





One of Neumann's primary thesis' is that consciousness in the individual
repeats the developmental stages of humanity (this comes right from Jung
and Nietzsche). Whenever we speak of creation of the world, we are talking
about the birth of the individual psyche. When we talk about the hero
slaying the dragon, we are talking about the development of the individual
psyche out of the collective unconscious. As Neumann states: ... in every
individual life, consciousness re-experiences its emergence from the
unconscious in the growth of childhood, and every night in sleep, dying
with the sun, it sinks back into the depths of the unconscious, to be
reborn in the morning and begin the day anew. *Page 18*


The symbol Neumann lands on as his primary metaphor for creation myth stage of
the development of consciousness is the Uroboros. The Uroboros is an Egyptian
symbol for a cosmic creature that slays, weds and impregnates itself. A common
visual symbol for the uroboros is a snake eating its tail. It is seen in myths
of Egypt, India, Babylon, Rome, Navajo, Mexico and even in the Revelation of St.
John.  


What is so "illogical" about these symbols is they do mean the beginning and the
end, plenitude and nothingness, birth, life, death and resurrection all at the
same time.

* Uroboric Autarchy is not narcissism or auto eroticism. These are only
  valid in the case where there is a lack of development or
  maldevelopment. Autarchy is needed in the developmental process of
  consciousness. In cases of more mature development, the uroboric
  symbolism takes the for of a mandala moving toward the Self.

* Detachment from the uroboros and entry into the world encountering the
  principle of the opposites is the essential task of human development.

* Centroversion is the term Neumann uses for self-formation and
  development of personality. This is similar to Jung's term for
  individuation. He suggests Jung's emphasis was on the second half of
  life with individuation. For Neumann, the development of the ego in
  childhood is equally important so as to withstand the downward pressure
  of uroboric incest and disintegration into the unconscious. This is the
  precondition to further development and individuation.

* The uroboric symbolism in the beginning returns in later stages of
  development where ego development is replaced by the development of the
  Self or individuation.  When the principle of the opposites is
  transcended the uroboros returns as the mandala.

* The goal in adulthood is to detach from the world not launch into it.
  This is a freedom from the world an coming into one's own. 

* This is the symbol of the circle of perfection with the arms of the
  cross where the opposites rest.  It is the place of transfiguration as
  well as illumination in addition to the place of mythological origin. 

* The great round arches over life encompassing man in his childhood and
  receiving him again at the end. 

* The round is this symbol of the beginning and the end. When the more
  developed ego clings to the round however the uroboros dominates over
  the ego we reach the stage of the Great Mother.
