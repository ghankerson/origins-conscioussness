# The Creation Myth and the Uroboros

* The mythological stages of the evolution of consciousness starts with the ego
  contained in the unconscious and leads up to the ego becoming self aware and
defending itself. Finally the ego is able to broaden its horizons. 

* The first stage is the creation myth which consist of birth, suffering and
  emancipation and is projected as the mythology of creation. 

* When the world parents finally separate, the young ego asserts itself. At this
  stage humanity become self-aware.

* In the beginning is perfection and wholeness. The beginning though is a
  virtual stage that cannot be described rationally but only symbolically.

* As soon as the rational mind tries grab on to this idea of the beginning plus
  end, creation plus destruction, the idea slips through the fingers. For this
reason a symbol stands at the beginning. 

* The beginning can be seen as two places the birth of the world and of the
  individual. 

* The beginning projects itself mythologically as the beginning of the world.
  These myths begin with the world because in this virtual stage there is no
separation between the world and the individual psyche. The individual psyche is
"knows itself as the world and in the world experiences the its own becoming as
world becoming, its own images as the starry heavens and its own contents as the
world-creating gods."

* In virtually all myths creation is the creation of light which is symbolically
  consciousness. Consciousness as light in contrast to the darkness of the
unconscious is the real object of creation mythology.

* Before the light we still have the virtual stage of creation which precedes
  the light is surrounded by a series of symbols. 

* Symbols and images are not rational statements and do not hold up to logic.
  Rather they surround an idea describing it from many sides. The psyche works
in symbols not logic. The psyche looks at the question of the beginning and
asks "Where did I come from or Whence?" It is the same question for the
individual and the world. 

* The answers all come symbolically from deep in the psyche: the unconscious.
The psyche blends and weaves ideas together even if they are contradictory.
Symbolic meaning is rich but elusive. It contains something conscious and
familiar and something unconscious and out of reach.

* A symbol group around an idea however can make something unknown more capable of
becoming conscious.

* The beginning has a common symbol in a circle. Its allies are a sphere, and
  egg and the round of alchemy. All of symbols in this group  are
self-contained without beginning or end. Without history, time, space or
consciousness. All this comes with the light which is "under the sway of the
umanifest godhead whose symbol is the circle."

* It is the beginning because the opposites are still united; the world parents
are in perpetual embrace, and it is the end because the opposites have united
again bringing the world to rest. 

* The world parents are united and thus are male and female: the or great
  hermaphrodite.

* One symbol is the T'ai C'hi containing black and white, day and night, male
  and female. This symbol is half black and half white each half containing a
smaller circle with the opposite color inside it so the white half has a small
white circle and vice-versa.

*There was something formless yet complete,
That existed before heaven and earth,
Without sound sound, without substance
Dependent on nothing, unchanging
All pervading, unfailing
One may think of it as the mother of all things under heaven.*
*Tao Teh Ching*

* Members of this symbol group appear in Egypt, New Zealand, Greece, Africa and
  India. The symbol group in these myths are universal - the World Parent or
Heaven and Earth lying on top of one another united timelessly.  This again is
the great hermaphrodite that contains the masculine and the feminine.

* The Hindu *purusha* combines the poles or the opposites and is the primal
  creative element

*In the beginning the world was Soul (Atman) alone in the form of a person.
Looking around he saw nothing else than himself. He said first: "I am." He was,
indeed, as large as a woman and a man closely embraced. He caused that self to
fall (pat) into two pieces. Therefrom arose a husband and a wife.*

Similarly, Plato in Timaeus writes:

*And he established the universe a sphere revolving in a circle, one and
solitary, yet by reason of its excellence able to bear himself company, and
needing no other friendship or aquaintance.*

* The perfection that rests in itself in no way contradicts the perfection
  which encircles itself.  The part that encircles is static, eternal and
unchanging while the center is the germ cell of creativity - the potential for
forward momentum.

* This circular snake or dragon that bites its own tale is the self-begetting
  uroboros of which the Egyptians say "it slays, it weds, and impregnates
  itself".

* The uroboros is full of contradictory opposites man and woman, giving birth
  and slaying to end life it is active and passive above and below all at once.

* The uroboros is known to ancient Babylon, the Mandaeans, the Phoenicians,
  Egyptians, in the Revelation of St. John, the Gnostics, the Navajo, Mexico and
India.

* Today the concepts around the symbol of the uroboros are difficult for us to
  grasp. It is all and it is nothing. It is wholeness and unity as well as
non-differentiation or the absence of opposites. The modern mind only sees this
as paradox but symbols and images can contain this contradiction and still be whole.
Jung often speaks of holding the tension of the opposites. 

* The symbols of our past are still alive today in the individual psyche, in
  dreams and fantasies.  As long as humanity exists the circle will be a symbol
of perfection: the primal deity that is sufficient unto itself and the self that
has gone beyond the opposites will appear as the mandala. 

* The round is the symbolic representation of the dawn of the world, the dawn
  of consciousness, and the dawn of the individual. It is "recollected" with the
birth of every newborn. It is a psychic stage that exists before the formation
of the ego and is re-experienced in each child. 

* The embryonic ego sleeps in the round and wakes up. The ego will later call
  this prenatal time.  The time before the separation of the opposites where
there is still no consciousness. There is not time or history or space but
eternity and infinity.

* The question of "Whence?" has one answer - the round  and two interpretations:
  the womb and the parents.  

* Neumann states "It is crucial for every psychology, and especially for every
  psychology of childhood to understand this problem and its symbolism.

* The uroboros appears as the womb but also as the masculine and feminine in
  perpetual union - the World Parents. The later is a symbol of the creation of
  the world not sexual. It is concerned with the origin of life, the spirit and
  the soul.  These are symbols of the collective unconscious not of the ego.

* Ancient people did not understand these themes consciously but they created
  myths around these themes. Mythology being a product of the collective
  unconscious shows us these themes of the uroboros via myth and symbol that are
  from the collective unconscious.

* Many ancient cultures did not even recognize the connection between sex and
  birth. We just come from the womb and so the round of mythology is a symbolic
  womb - a place of origin from whence we come and not just a individual where
  we are from but a collective place where many unconscious contents lie waiting
  to be born.  Its not a womb or a mother but Wombs or Mothers.

* Symbols in this group include anything deep, an abyss, a valley, ground, the
  sea, fountains, lakes pools the earth, the underworld, caves, a house and the
  city. Anything big and embracing that preserves, wraps and nourishes belong to
  this group of symbols. 

* Human consciousness at this stage is nascent and under the dominance of the
  uroboros.  The ego still sees itself as the world and the world as itself. The
  initial stage of the infantile ego is marked by the predominance of the
  maternal side of the uroboros.
  
 * In this stage the world is all embracing and the ego tires easily and sinks
   back into the embrace of the Great Mother.  

 * The Great Mother in this stage has all the positive maternal attributes:
   nourishing, sheltering, protecting, warmth, comfort, and forgiveness. It is
   an image of paradise that cannot be realized in adult life.
 
 * The Great and Good Mother embody this stage of the uroboros and are not seen
   again until a much later stage of development where she returns as the wise
   Sophia as the "Mother of All Living".

 * This state of perfection and contentment was never a historical one but is
   a psychological one and we just see the outlines of it. This state has
   a downward drag toward unconsciousness that is a natural force in the psyche.
   The counteracting force of a drive toward consciousness is the force that
   requires effort and striving (The Hero's Journey). The struggle between the
   specifically human and the universally natural constitutes the history of
   man's conscious development as ancient man continuously had to confront
   nature to survive.

 * As long as the ego is weak the downward drag toward unconsciousness is felt
   as pleasure and safety while ego consciousness is felt as heavy and weak. As
   long as this holds the ego submits to the uroboros.

  * Neumann calls this stage uroboric incest. It is not incest in the sexual
    sense but a symbol of return to unconsciouss. He also calls it a precursor
    to the hierros gamos (sacred marriage) which comes later with the hero. 

  * Uroboric incest is a form of re-entry to the mother or to the unconscious.
    It is a desire to be dissolved and absorbed and is pleasureful. The Great
    Mother takes the child bake into herself. Symbols associated with uroboric
    incest include the cave, the earth, tomb, coffin, urn and sarcophagus. The
    signia of death is associated with uroboric incest.

  * He equates nostalgia and drunkenness as forms of uroboric incest. It is
    self-surrender associated with an infant ego or a sick ego unable to
    individuate further. Its can even be a tired, old ego creeping back to the
    mother after finding fullfillment.
	
  * The infant ego does not experience uroboric incest as hostile even though it
    will be annihilated. It expreiences this as a a return to innocence, safety
    and pleasure a form of rebirth.

  * So far we have addresses the maternal aspect of the uroboros, but there is
    also the paternal aspect. The world parents is another image for the answer
    "Where do I come from?" At the stage of the uroboros the world parents are
    still locked in perpetual embrace. Mother and father, heaven and earth, Goad
    and world are still one. There are not yet any opposites.

  * The world parents are a symbol of everlasting life. They are the great
    hermaphrodite and the place from which everything springs. They are the
    force that begets, conceives, birtths itself, kills and revivifies. It
    a symbol of the place beyond opposites but also a place of new beginning:
    "The Wheel that rolls itself."

  * The paternal side of the uroboros is the procreative thrust that kicks
    eveything off including the evolution of time. Neumann notes that this is
    harder to visualize than the maternal side of the uroboros. It does sound
    quite strange to us as modern humans. Take these examples from Egyptian
    mythology.

  * From the Book of Apopis:
  *I copulated in my hand. I joined myself with my shadow and spurted out of my
  own mouth. I spewed forth as Shu and spat forth as Tefnut*

  * From Pyramid Texts:
  *Atum, who indulged himself in Heliopolis, took his phallus in order to arouse
  pleasure. A brother and sister were produced, Shu and Tefnut.*

 * This is a symbol of the creative beginning. The paternal side of the uroboros
   creates a brother and a sister by joining himself with this shadow or
   opposite (the feminine).  He calls this the image of the self-fecundating
   primal god. Neumann suggests then that this image is better crystallized
   later in new variations of these myths where the image moves towards
   spiritualization. These examples help us understand the idea further. Keep in
   mine that the Egyptian hieroglyphs for thought is the heart and speech is the
   tongue.

 *It is the heart (thought) which makes all that results come out, and it is the
 tongue which repeats (expresses) the thought of the heart... That is what
 causes the gods to be born. Atum with his Ennead, and every divine utterance
 manifests itself in the the thought of the heart and the speech of the tongue.*

* Finally more refined: *He did not bring me forth from his mouth, nor conceive
  me in his hand, but he breathed me forth from his nostrils.* 
  
* This is all still from Egyptian myth but we are already at the point where the
  "breath of life" is very similar to the Christian Logos.  

* *"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
  God"*
  
* Neumann suggests the expression of the Logos in the Bible never broke
  completely from the idea of the self-fecundating, self-manifesting god.
  
  
  
  
  
  One of Neumann's primary thesis' is that consciousness in the individual
  repeats the developmental stages of humanity (this comes right from Jung and
  Nietzsche). Whenever we speak of creation of the world, we are talking about
  the birth of the individual psyche. When we talk about the hero slaying the
  dragon, we are talking about the development of the individual psyche out of
  the collective unconscious. As Neumann states: ... in every individual life,
  consciousness re-experiences its emergence from the unconscious in the growth
  of childhood, and every night in sleep, dying with the sun, it sinks back into
  the depths of the unconscious, to be reborn in the morning and begin the day
  anew.  *Page 18*

This book is all myth, symbols and archetypes. Neumann describes symbols as
coming from the collective unconscious and they are not logical or rationale. To
understand symbols we have to know that they are metaphor. Symbols can contain
rich and even contradictory images. The symbols Neumann finds around creation
are symbols of perfection: the round, a circle as it is self-contained without
beginning or end: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
the last." *Revelations 22:13 King James Bible* 

Since symbols are rich, heavy and contradictory, they are best understood by
circling around them, examining them from many angles. In fact an archetype is a
series or constellation of symbols around a topic. Related symbols for creation
include the World Egg, the world parents locked in perpetual embrace, the
Chinese T'ai Chi illustrates this as well being a dark and a light half of a
circle each containing a spec of its opposite. The T'ai Chi is really the same
thing symbolically  as the World Parents, Heaven and Earth melded together, the
symbolic masculine and feminine fused together. 

The symbol Neumann lands on as his primary metaphor for creation myth stage of
the development of consciousness is the Uroboros. The Uroboros is an Egyptian
symbol for a cosmic creature that slays, weds and impregnates itself. A common
visual symbol for the uroboros is a snake eating its tail. It is seen in myths
of Egypt, India, Babylon, Rome, Navajo, Mexico and even in the Revelation of St.
John.  

The uroboros first appears in the Egyptian Book of the Dead around 1600 B.C.E as
the self-creating god Atum rose from primordial waters in the figure of a snake
renewing himself every morning
[Crystalinks](https://www.crystalinks.com/ouroboros.html).

What is so "illogical" about these symbols is they do mean the beginning and the
end, plenitude and nothingness, birth, life, death and resurrection all at the
same time.

##Sub-stages in the first stage of consciousness Neumann presents three
sub-stages to this first stage in the development of consciousness. He calls
them stages of uroboric autacracy (autacracy in this case is akin to dominance
or rule). 

###The Pleromatic Stage
This first stage he describes as "the pleromatic" (divine plenitude)  stage of
paradisal perfection in the unborn, the embryonic stage of the ego, which a
later consciousness will contrast with suffering of the non-autacratic ego in
the world."

This needs some unpacking. This first sub-stage is before consciousness, before
ego and before history. Since it is before it is a virtual or a priori stage.
The analogy here is like the child in the womb of its mother. The mother or the
womb provides all, and in fact there is no distinction between child and mother
or ego and world. It is paradisal as all is provided for and there is no
suffering. "An embryonic ego still undeveloped germ of ego consciousness
slumbers in the perfect round." 

Neumann quotes Plato as an example in this example: Therefore the demuriege made
the world in the shape of a sphere, giving it that figure which of all is the
most perfect and equal of itself.  

He also cites Lao-tzu on again the t'ai chi: There was something formless yet
complete, That existed before heaven and earth, Without sound, without
substance, Depending on nothing, unchnaging, All pervading, unfailing, One may
think of it as the mother of all things under heaven.

The round or uroboros can also be interpreted as the World Parents - the union
of feminine and masculine opposites in perpetual embrace. From Babylonian myth:
When on high the heaven had not been named Firm ground below had not been called
by name, Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter, (And) Mummu-Tiamat, she who
bore them all, Their waters comingling as a single body.

####Creation or Birth
So while the World Parents present a picture of static
pre-history - the perpetual embrace, we need a related but perhaps contradictory
symbol for birth.  Since the uroboros is in part the beginning, birth, creation,
or the wheel that rolls itself we find myths of self-impregnating gods
(pro)creating without a partner.  In Egyptian theology the god Atum procreates
by himself. From the Egyptian Pyramid Text:

	In the beginning there was nothing (Nun). A mound of earth rose from Nun
and upon it Atum created himself.  He spat Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture) from
his mouth.  Atum’s two offspring became separated from him and lost in the dark
nothingness, so Atum sent his “Eye” to look for them.  When they were found, he
named Shu as “life” and Tefnut as “order” and entwined them together.	[Ancient
Egypt Online](https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/atum/).

In other versions of the Egyptian creation myth Atum create offspring via
masturbation. From the book of Apopis: Atum, who indulged himself in Heliopolis,
took his phalis in his hand to arouse pleasure, a brohter and sister were
produced Shu and Tefnut.

Neumann notes how this kind of creation myth becomes more sophisticated over
time and leans into the idea of spiritualization or inspiration. Hindi myths
express how thinking and introversion are the equivalent of emitting heat a
creative force:

	He found foothold on the earth. When he had found a firm foothold there,
he thought: I will propagate myself. He emitted heat and became pregnant.

Thought, and introversion become spirit and later in Christianity the Logos: In
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
John 1:1	

Neumann states that even the Logos still hints at the uroboric idea of the
self-manifesting god.   

 
####Death or Uroboric Incest Neumann notes that the natural impulse of the
pleromatic stage is not for consciousness to bubble up, but for the ego to
return to a restful state in the uroboros. He calls this "uroboric incest" or
and entry back into the mother (womb). As the nascent ego sparks into existence
it's tendency is to return to unity with the mother. There is no pleasure or
sexual meaning here. Neumann describes this as "passively letting oneself being
taken". We can see how this image could be associated with longing, nostalgia,
depression or even suicidal ideation. This is a negative reflection of the
*hierros gamos* or sacred marriage (union of heaven and earth) that can occur in
later stages of consciousness development. Since uroboric incest is a return to
the mother or earth it is a kind of death that can be symbolized by a tomb,
sarcophagus, cave, coffin or sunset. As the symbolism of the uroboros suggests
the ego or child is then reborn at sunrise.


###The Alimentary Uroboros The second sub-stage he calls the alimentary
uroboros. The symbolism here focuses on consumption of food or prey and bodily
output as birth. The serpent consumes its own waste as food and thus recreates
itself. This creates the circle or ring that binds.
